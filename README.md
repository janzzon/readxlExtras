# readxlExtras  
Do not use this package any more. Broken dependencies with pkg readxl.  
Since a couple of years is read_excel evaluating all desired rows correctly, readxlExtras is obsolete.  
Description: Import excel files into R. This package is just a minor rewrite of
    readxl::read_excel(), see package readxl for original authors information.  
    All rows are evaluated in xls_col_types and xlsx_col_types, this is supposed 
    to be the only difference compared to readxl::read_excel()
